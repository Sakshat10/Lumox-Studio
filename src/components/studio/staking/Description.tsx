          <p className="mt-4 text-left  text-base/6 text-neutral-200">
            <span className="font-semibold">24-Hour Lock: </span> Tokens are
            locked for just 24 hours. After this period, you can claim your
            tokens anytime.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-left  text-base/6 text-neutral-200">
            <span className="font-semibold">Hourly Rewards: </span> Rewards are
            calculated hourly. The longer you stake, the more you earnâ€”up to 60%
            APY.

          How It Works:
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-left  text-base/6 text-neutral-200">
          When you stake your Lumox tokens, they are locked for the first 24
          hours.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-left  text-base/6 text-neutral-200">
          After this lock period, your tokens are free to withdraw whenever you
          choose.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-left  text-base/6 text-neutral-200">
          If you leave your tokens staked, you earn hourly rewards, similar to
          earning interest in a bank.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-left  text-base/6 text-neutral-200">
          The longer your tokens remain staked, the higher your rewards. For
          instance, leaving your tokens in staking for a month can earn you up
          to 60% more tokens.
